# lucy-mk-2

The Lucy Android next generation build project.

This repository turns the Lucy Mk-II concept into a buildable prototype using:

- FDM 3D printing for plastic parts
- External fabrication service for metal parts

## Document Map

- `01-project-brief.md`: scope, assumptions, and success criteria
- `02-system-architecture.md`: subsystem decomposition and interfaces
- `03-mechanical-design.md`: structure, joints, materials, and CAD strategy
- `04-electronics-control.md`: power, compute, motor control, sensing, and wiring
- `05-manufacturing-plan.md`: print rules, outsourced metal process, tolerances, and DFM
- `06-assembly-integration.md`: assembly sequence, fixtures, calibration, and integration workflow
- `07-test-validation.md`: verification matrix and acceptance tests
- `08-risk-register.md`: technical risks with mitigations
- `bom-v0.1.csv`: preliminary bill of materials
- `work-breakdown.md`: phased execution plan

## Current Status

This is `v0.1` planning and architecture. No CAD or fabrication files are generated yet.
