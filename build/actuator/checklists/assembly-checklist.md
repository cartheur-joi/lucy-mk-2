## Stage 1: Mechanical Core

- Motor mount is flat and fully seated to datum.
- Bearing blocks align without forced preload.
- Shaft spins freely by hand through full rotation.
- No rubbing against housing in full range.
- Threadlocker applied only where specified.

## Stage 2: Fasteners and Inserts

- Correct screw length at each location.
- Heat-set inserts held without rotation.
- No over-torque signs in printed parts.
- Captive nuts and washers installed where required.

## Stage 3: Harness and Electronics Interface

- Cable routing has service loop at moving boundary.
- No pinch points at full articulation range.
- Connector orientation keyed and strain relieved.
- Sensor bracket and wire guides secured.

## Stage 4: Bench Validation

- Manual range check passes before power.
- Low-current power-on check passes.
- Homing or reference motion executes predictably.
- Backlash measured and logged.
- Thermal check after initial motion cycle.

## Stage 5: Handoff

- Assembly photos saved in `assembly/`.
- Issues list logged with part IDs.
- BOM delta captured in `bom/`.
- Next action assigned: proceed, reprint, or redesign.
